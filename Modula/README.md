# MODULA a module based tool holder system

The idea is, one adapter plate (metric/imperial/plain) that attaches to a module.
Then everyone can share the modules worldwide, and just adjust the adapter plate for their environment.

The system works with PEG/Tool boards and plain wall/board surfaces (attached with screws).
The adapter IÂ´ve made is compatible with peg/tool boards from Biltema, Jula, Claes Ohlosson, CC 12mm (15/32 inch) spacing of the 4mm (5/32 inch) diameter screw holes.

The module snaps on to the next module with dovetales, and the screw holes can be keept in this module hence giving more space for tool holding without need for screw holes through the whole design. 

Finally, You have the choice of designing Your own adapter tailored to Your needs i.e, pegboard, inches, square holes etc, and modules for Your tools. We should probably should put these files on Printables.
